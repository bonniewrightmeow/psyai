## Writing Approach

This draft follows scientific writing best practices from the referenced paper on "How to Write a Research Manuscript":

### Key Principles Applied

1. **Clear Structure:** Standard IMRaD format (Introduction, Methods, Results, Discussion)
2. **Objective Tone:** Factual, third-person presentation
3. **Concise Writing:** Direct statements without unnecessary complexity
4. **Evidence-Based:** All claims supported by data or citations
5. **Logical Flow:** Each section builds on previous content

### Section-Specific Approach

**Introduction:**
- Establishes significance (95% AI adoption failure rate)
- Reviews current knowledge and gaps
- States clear hypotheses (primary and secondary)
- Defines specific research objectives

**Materials and Methods:**
- Detailed enough for replication
- Four experimental conditions clearly defined
- Comprehensive description of materials (Centaur Model, API, UI)
- Statistical analysis plan specified

**Results:**
- Objective presentation of findings
- Hypothetical data based on expected outcomes
- Statistical significance reported with effect sizes
- Tables and figures planned

**Discussion:**
- Interprets findings in context of hypotheses
- Compares with existing literature
- Addresses limitations honestly
- Proposes future research directions

**Abstract:**
- Structured format (Background, Objective, Methods, Results, Conclusions)
- Self-contained summary of entire paper
- Includes key findings and implications

## Important Notes

### Hypothetical Results

⚠️ **The Results section contains hypothetical data** based on the research design and expected outcomes from Outline 2. Actual data will be collected during the Q1 2026 study.

**Hypothetical elements marked throughout:**
- Mean accuracy: 72.4% (target >80%)
- Decision throughput improvements
- Cognitive load reductions
- All statistical tests and p-values

**What will change with real data:**
- All numerical results
- Statistical significance levels
- Effect sizes
- Interpretation of findings
- Some aspects of Discussion based on actual outcomes

### Research Alignment

This draft is fully aligned with:
- **Research Outline 2:** All hypotheses, objectives, and methods from the outline
- **Epic Structure:** Maps to Epics 1-3 from project documentation
- **Q1 2026 Timeline:** Written to support planned study execution

## How to Use This Draft

### For Researchers

1. **Review for Accuracy:** Check alignment with research outline and project goals
2. **Identify Gaps:** Note any missing content or unclear sections
3. **Suggest Improvements:** Propose changes to methodology or analysis plan
4. **Prepare for Study:** Use Methods section to guide implementation

### For LLM Contributors

1. **Read PROJECT_CONTEXT.md** for research overview
2. **Review relevant epic docs** (Epic 1, 2, or 3) for technical context
3. **Reference this draft** when implementing features
4. **Maintain alignment** with research objectives described here

### For Editing

Each section can be edited independently. When making changes:
- Maintain scientific writing style (clear, concise, objective)
- Ensure changes align with research hypotheses
- Update FULL_PAPER.md if major structural changes occur
- Track changes if using version control
