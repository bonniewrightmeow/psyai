# PsyAI Documentation

This directory contains research documentation, epic specifications, and architectural details for the PsyAI project.

## Directory Structure

### `/research`
Research papers, references, and theoretical foundations:
- Research paper citations and summaries
- Theoretical frameworks (Centaur Model, HITL, LLM-as-a-judge)
- Study design and methodology
- Data analysis plans

### `/epics`
Epic and story specifications from the research outline:
- Epic 1: CENTAUR Model Integration Prototype
- Epic 2: Expert Review User Interface
- Epic 3: Analytics and Research Dashboard
- User stories with acceptance criteria
- Technical specifications per epic

### `/architecture`
Technical architecture and design documentation:
- System architecture diagrams
- Platform layer design
- Feature layer design
- API specifications
- Database schemas
- Integration patterns

## Primary Research Document

The main research outline is located at:
```
Collaborative Writing/psyAI Research Paper - Outline 2.md
```

This serves as the source of truth for:
- Research hypotheses and objectives
- Epic and story definitions
- Requirements and success metrics
- Expected results

## Contributing to Documentation

When adding documentation:
1. Ensure alignment with the research outline
2. Use clear, scientific writing principles
3. Link to relevant code implementations
4. Include diagrams where helpful
5. Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## For LLM Contributors

Start with `PROJECT_CONTEXT.md` in the root directory for a comprehensive overview of the project, then dive into specific documentation areas as needed.
